# Chaotic Pendulum Experiment

A driven dampened pendulum as utilized in this experiment exhibits the behaviors of a [linear] driven dampened oscillator (with point mass removed) as well as [nonlinear] behavior with the point mass attached.  Under certain operating conditions, chaotic behavior can be observed in the dampened-driven pendulum.
